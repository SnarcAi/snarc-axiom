# Commercial License — SNARC AXIOM Protocol Specification

## What requires a commercial license

The protocol specification files in `spec/` are licensed under
CC BY-NC 4.0 for non-commercial use.

A **commercial license** is required if you intend to:

- Build a product or service for commercial gain that is substantially
  derived from or implements this specification
- Include the specification (in whole or in part) in commercial documentation,
  SDK, or platform materials
- Offer a hosted or managed service based on this protocol
- Use the specification as the basis for a funded project (VC-backed,
  grant-funded above a threshold, or revenue-generating)

## What does NOT require a commercial license

- Academic research and publication
- Non-commercial open-source implementations
- Student projects and coursework
- Internal evaluation and prototyping (without deployment)
- Citing the paper or specification in academic work
- Forking the repo for research purposes

## Definition: non-commercial use

Non-commercial use means use that is not primarily intended for, or directed
toward, commercial advantage or monetary compensation.
When in doubt, contact us before building.

## How to obtain a commercial license

Contact the maintainers via a GitHub Issue titled
**[Commercial License Inquiry]** or via the contact address listed in the
paper once deanonymized.

Please include:

1. Organization name and type (startup, enterprise, individual, etc.)
2. Brief description of intended use
3. Approximate scale (users, transactions, deployment region)
4. Timeline

We aim to respond within 10 business days.

## License grant

A commercial license will be granted as a written agreement specifying:

- Scope of use (product, geography, duration)
- Attribution requirements
- Royalty terms (if applicable) or one-time fee
- Conditions for sublicensing

Commercial licensees will be listed in the repository's
`COMMERCIAL_LICENSEES.md` (with consent) as a transparency measure.

## No warranty

A commercial license grants the right to use the specification commercially.
It does not imply any warranty of correctness, security, or fitness for
a particular purpose. The specification is provided as-is.
All deployment obligations (audits, security, regulatory compliance)
remain with the licensee.
